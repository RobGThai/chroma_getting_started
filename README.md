Attack stance will allow the companion to attack a target. Guard stance companion will not be able to attack but cannot be attacked with other companion as well.

Companion will leave the field once its HP depleted. They lose HP by getting attacked by other companions, spells, or abilities.

**Spell**

Each spell card has unique effect written on the card. In this case `Blossom`, heal any card for three HP and draw one card. Spell card does not require a page to be played and it takes no space on the board as well. The effect of spell card is a one-time use. Spell card can be used to damage guarded companion mentioned above.

**Enchantment**

Enchantment card is similar to spell card but its effect is for a period of time. This period of time can be seen by the yellow number at the bottom of the card and counting down each of your turn. The card will leave the page once the number reach zero and the effect will stop.

**Landmark**
