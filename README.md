# Gameplay

In Chroma, your goal is to get your opponent hero's HP to 0 via cards and abilities. You take turn doing so until one of your HP depleted.

**Companion**

![companion card](assets/companion.jpg)

This is your conventional mean to attack. Each card have damage number (in red) and health (in green). Companion must be play into one of the seven pages in front of you. Simply drag the card on to the empty space in front of you. Companion card on the field can change between attack and guard stance as you see fit.

![attack](assets/attack.jpg) ![guard](assets/guard.jpg)

Attack stance will allow the companion to attack a target. Guard stance companion will not be able to attack but cannot be attacked with other companion as well.

Companion will leave the field once its HP depleted. They lose HP by getting attacked by other companions, spells, or abilities.

Some companions have abilities you can use with mana as well, this show up as a coin on that companion on the field.

**Spell**

Each spell card has unique effect written on the card. In this case `Blossom`, heal any card for three HP and draw one card. Spell card does not require a page to be played and it takes no space on the board as well. The effect of spell card is a one-time use. Spell card can be used to damage guarded companion mentioned above.

**Enchantment**

Enchantment card is similar to spell card but its effect is for a period of time. This period of time can be seen by the yellow number at the bottom of the card and counting down each of your turn. The card will leave the page once the number reach zero and the effect will stop.

Enchantment can be a stanalone card or accompanying a companion (as seen above in `Radiance`). In the case of enchanted companion; Once the companion is defeated, it will turn into enchantment on the same page. When this happens, the countdown will start.

**Landmark**

Landmark is similar to enchantment card but it has plate protecting it. Plate is similar to HP but counting instance of attack instead of damage. For example, to destroy `The Boundless Spire` above you need to attack it 6 times.
